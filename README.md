# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters. The model utilizes various machine learning algorithms and medical datasets to provide an accurate assessment of heart disease risk.

## Features
- Predicts the risk of heart disease based on medical data.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Provides an interactive user interface for input and result visualization.
- Can be integrated with web applications for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a publicly available heart disease dataset, such as the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**. The dataset contains features like:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Chest Pain Type
- ECG Results
- Exercise-Induced Angina

## Model Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like:
- Accuracy -  0.8512396694214877

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with advanced ML models (e.g., Deep Learning).
- Deploy as a cloud-based API.
- Enhance UI for better user experience.
